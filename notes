[COMPILING]
    (while in the .c file folder)

    (compile C)
    gcc -o program yourcode.c // creates an executable file called 'a.out'  
    or
    gcc yourcode.c

    (run C)
    ./a.out
    or
    ./program
    
     (compile C++)
     g++ -o program yourcode.cpp // creates an executable file called 'a.out'
     or
     g++ yourcode.cpp

     (run C++)
     ./a.out
     or
     ./program

[FILES AND DIRECTORIES]
    ~ = /home/user

    (navigation)
    ls // list directory
    cd folder_name // change directory, goes inside 'folder_name' directory
    cd .. // goes outside current folder, navigating up one level
    
    (where am I?)
    pwd // 'print working directory', shows the complete path to our current directory
    
    (create folder)
    mkdir folder_name_here // you can indicate a directory path instead of creating a file in the current one
    
    (delete folder)
    rmdir folder_name_here // you can indicate a directory path instead of deleting files in the current one
